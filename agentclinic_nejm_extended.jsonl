Two years before presentation, she had started applying a skin-lightening cream containing hydroquinone to her face daily to treat melasma. On physical examination, bluish-brown patches with background erythema and telangiectasias were observed on the cheeks, nasal bridge, and perioral region, with lesser involvement on the forehead (left). Dermoscopy of the affected areas revealed hyperchromic, pinpoint macules (middle). A skin-biopsy sample from the left cheek showed extracellular deposition of yellow-brown, banana-shaped bodies in the dermis (right, hematoxylin and eosin stain). What is the most likely diagnosis?", "patient_info": "For your role as a patient, you are a 55-year-old woman who has noticed your skin darkening on your face over the past year. You began using a skin-lightening cream containing hydroquinone daily two years ago to address melasma. You've observed bluish-brown patches on your cheeks, nasal bridge, and around your mouth, with some patches also appearing on your forehead. These patches have a background of redness and you've noticed some small, visible blood vessels in these areas.
